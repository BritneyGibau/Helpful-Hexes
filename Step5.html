  <h2> Step 5: Don't Tell Outsiders</h2>

  <p> The Fact that you were linked to this website by an old hobo, had to enter a specific password, and crack a three riddle barrier is proof that this website should be kept in upmost secrecy.</p>

  <p> Magic resides in Arcadia, and Arcadia alone for it is a force that the mortals of the Earth Realm must never find out about. Not only will it cause hysteria, but also intrigue mad scientists and greedy businesses to try and exploit Arcadia's resources. A war could even stir from rising confict. But the worst thing that could possibly happen is that magic could end up disappearing.</p>
  <p> Magic is dubbed as "magic" because of it's mysterious techniques, ideas, and methods that most can not fathom or understand. Once magic is deciphered and understood, it will become common sense, logical, and will no longer be called "magic". Then we will strive for something else to call "magic". Something else we don't understand but will try to master nonetheless, but we could end up coming to the end of human understanding that way. We aren't suggesting that you become a shut-in or anything, just that you can keep this secret. Would be unfortunate if something bad were to happen to you...</p>
