  <h1> How to be a Magician</h1>
  <h2> Step 3: Organize your supplies</h2>

<img src="img/VECTOR8.svg" class="imageHelper">



  <p> Organize, Organize, ORGANIZE! Organization is everything! If you don't plan on becoming a magician for the sake of learning how to craft materia and selling them, you will need many supplies to further your studies. What if you finally find that spell for summoning the Aroma Slime you've been dying to make into a familiar for more than a month now? You finally have the spell, you have your supplies, but you don't know where they are! And don't even consider improvising either, because unless the spell lists alternative potions or materials, it's because you're not suppose to improvise.</p>

  <p> There is a variety of ways to organize your potions, and luckily here are the basics for supply organization. Color, element, and Purpose. Potions can come in many colors, matters on the materials that they are made out of, but seperating them by color makes it easier as some spell books will describe said potion's color. Have your color categories set up as that of the rainbow, and miscellaneous colors such as Monochrome or brown can be left in their own category as they usually have neutral ingredients that can be unresponsive to many potions while the brightly and vibrantly colored potions have a more complicated set up of ingredients and are very reactive.</p>
  <p> Such as the basics of magic, potions and other materials also have elements. Salamander's breathe being fire, Undyne Tears being water, Sylph strands being air, Gnome shards being earth, Glacius scales being ice, Thunderbird feathers being lightning, and Alraune roots being Fungi. Element separation is used by most Novice magicians as most materials come from a single element. Also with basic common sense, any magician will know that opposite materials usually don't mix well.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is purpose. Purpose in potions and materials is used mostly by alchemists for how advance the categories can get. Some potions or materials are for explosions, some for healing, some for growing, some for shrinking, and some even for killing. However, it does work swimmingly when spells also have certain purposes, and focusing on the materials that have the same purpose will make finding your ingredients much easier.</p>
